# Designing for emergence

## Abstract

As video games mature as a medium, and an ever-increasing differentiation in genres, content, and target audiences takes place in the space, questions arise about all the possible approaches that can be used when designing gameplay systems. Most broadly, gameplay systems can be categorized as systems of progression and systems of emergence, and games that rely mostly on either can be categorized as games of progression or games of emergence. In this work I will attempt to lay out the basics of game design approaches that focus on creating emergence and implement them in a prototype of a political strategy and management game.

## Games of emergence and games of progression

Games that rely mostly on either emergence or progression can be thought of as games of emergence or games of progression, but most games will incorporate both of these categories in their gameplay. Strategy games often feature scripted storylines despite heavily relying on complex tactical maneuvering and economy systems, while most adventure games have at least a rudimentary combat or inventory management system to supplement their mostly narrative-based gameplay.

Visual novels may be taken as an example of pure games of progression, where every possible state of the game has been scripted and accounted for by the developers, while chess, with its practically uncountable unique playthroughs would be the poster child for pure games of emergence.
